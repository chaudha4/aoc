Day 1 - Calorie Counting
-------------------

[Problem statement][d01-problem] — [Complete solution][d01-solution] — [Back to top][top]

### Part 1

Welcome to AoC 2022! First day, easiest problem: we are given a list of integers
divided in chunks by empty lines, and we need to find the chunk whose integers
have the greatest sum.

There are a couple easy ways of parsing today's input, I took advantage of a
[list comprehension][py-list-comprehension] coupled with the
[`map()`][py-builtin-map] to do this in two lines.

First we read the entire input and [`.split()`][py-str-split] its content on
empty lines (i.e. two consecutive newline characters `\n\n`):

```python
fin = open(...)
chunks = fin.read().split('\n\n')
# ['1000\n2000\n3000', '4000', '5000\n6000']
```

To transform a single chunk from a single string into a list of integers we can
`.split()` it again and then use `tuple(map(int, chunk))` to turn it into a
[`tuple`][py-tuple] of `int` (we could also transform it into a
[`list`][py-list], but for things that should be immutable it's good practice to
use a `tuple`). To do the same for *all* chunks we can either use
[`map()`][py-builtin-map] again or a *list comprehension*. In this case, the
latter is easier to write:

```python
chunks = [tuple(map(int, chunk.split())) for chunk in chunks]
# [(1000, 2000, 3000), (4000,), (5000, 6000)]
```

We end up with a list of tuples, and now we can search for the one whose sum is
the greatest. We can now `map()` each of those tuples into the `sum()` of its
elements and then use [`max()`][py-builtin-max] to find the greatest.

```python
best = max(map(sum, chunks))
print('Part 1:', best)
```

### Part 2

For the second part, we need to find the top 3 chunks with the greatest sums and
then sum their sums.

While in general there are algorithms such as [quickselect][algo-quickselect]
that are able to find the Nth largest elements of an unsorted sequence in
[linear time][wiki-linear-time] (i.e. *O(n)*), Python sadly does not provide any
such function in its standard library. However we're still very far from needing
such a level of optimization, and the list we are dealing with is pretty small.
The "naive" solution of [`.sort()`][py-list-sort]ing the chunks (*O(nlogn)*) and
then extracting the top 3 works just fine.

We pass `reverse=True` to sort in descending order, and `key=sum` to sort the
chunks according to the sum of their elements (the `key=` function is applied to
each chunk before comparing it with others).

```python
chunks.sort(key=sum, reverse=True)
best3 = sum(map(sum, chunks[:3]))

print('Part 2:', best3)
```
